# Guidelines to install and scoring with NTU SCLITE Docker

## Installation
1. Create working directory: In the terminal, type the following commands
	```console
	$ mkdir ~/docker-sclite-scoring
	$ cd ~/docker-sclite-scoring
	$ mkdir ./scoring_input
	```
2. Copy `ntu_sclite_scoring.tar` and `docker-compose_sclite-scoring.yml` into `~/docker-sclite-scoring` folder
3. Load and run docker image
	```console
	$ sudo docker load < ntu_sclite_scoring.tar
	```
4. Check if the docker image load was successful
	```console
	$ docker image ls
	```
5. You should see something likes the below (CREATED might be different):
	```console
	REPOSITORY                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
	> ntu_sclite_scoring                           1.0                 14442bb28483        32 minutes ago      763MB
	```
6. Start the docker container
	```console
	$ sudo docker-compose -f ./docker-compose_sclite-scoring.yml up
	```
7. Check if the system has been started
	```console
	$ sudo docker ps
	```
8. You should see something likes below (CONTAINERID might be different):
	```console
	945890a81466        ntu_sclite_scoring:1.0   "/workspace/entry_poâ€¦"   25 minutes ago      Up 25 minutes                           sclit-scoring_decoder_1
	```

## Scoring
1. Copy .ctm files generated by our asr engine to `~/docker-sclite-scoring/scoring_input` folder
2. Copy your edited .TextGrid files to `~/docker-sclite-scoring/scoring_input` folder. 
* Please note that the `.ctm` and TextGrid file names should be identical, for example: `test1.ctm` and `test1.TextGrid`
3. After about 5 minutes, you should see the following file extensions in your scoring_input folder: `.sys, .pra, .dtl`
4. By opening `.sys` file, you will see a report table as below:
![WER Report](images/wer.png)
* Here, you might only need to care about the first 5 results, `Corr` for Correction Rate, `Sub` for Substitution Rate, `Del` for Deletion Rate, Ins for Insertion Rate and `Err` for overall word error rate.
5. You also can see other detailed reports in `.pra .dtl` files
